# **philosophy**: 

I have my pc and I can use 12B models. But it is always great if we have atleast 1 free way to get cloud model service. As Hugging chat is free and opensource, I search A way to get It working.
First I searched For tools And then I Foud this wonderful tool https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api then I created A discussion On sillytavern Github https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/discussions/3813  to request this feature.

@Cohee1207 said I can fork And add it myself If I want. 
so here we are now we have this tool. Please help me more to make it even better.
